### About me
---
At 33, I'm looking to change my career and become a front-end developer. I have over 10 years of experience in the accounting field, but my passion for learning and passion for technology and the creative process led me to web development.
I took offline training in web design basics, where I mastered HTML, CSS and basic JavaScript skills. Also, I have successfully completed online courses in Python, including Django, SQLite and Flask. These courses gave me an understanding of the full cycle of web application development and allowed me to create my own projects.

I am sociable, open for cooperation and appreciate teamwork. I like to share knowledge and ideas with other members of a large community in order to find the best solutions together.
I believe that my ability to learn and acquire new skills will help me become an experienced Frontend Developer.
